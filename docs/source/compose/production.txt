######################
Production Environment
######################

The production environment uses a Cyphon image on Docker Hub as the
basis for its Cyphon container.

Settings for the production environment are contained in the 
``docker-compose.override.yml`` file. Docker Compose automatically reads  
both the ``docker-compose.yml`` and ``docker-compose.override.yml`` 
files when it builds an environment, unless other files are specified. 
So in this case, Docker will deploy the production environment by default.

To start up the (default) production environment::

    $ cd /opt/cyphon/cyphondock
    $ sudo docker-compose up -d


*********
Superuser
*********

To create a superuser for the production environment, enter the shell of the Django container::

    $ sudo docker exec -it cyphondock_cyphon_1 /bin/sh

Then create the superuser::

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

You can use this user to log in to Cyphon and create other user accounts.


*****
Ports
*****

The production environment will map the exposed ports in the containers 
to same ports on the host machine. This makes it straightforward to use 
the endpoints of the various services.

You can access Cyphon and some of its related services through your web 
browser. The following services can be accessed by visiting your host 
domain on the appropriate port (e.g., ``http://example.com:5601``):

===================  =====
Service              Port
===================  =====
Cyphon               80
Kibana               5601
RabbitMQ management  15672
===================  =====


************
Data Volumes
************

The production environment uses the subdirectories in ``/opt/cyphon/data``
as data volumes for PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, or MongoDB. This makes
the data from those services easy to locate and backup.
